#NJax:
_Micro-Service focused framework built on the MEAN Stack_

##Micro Services:
We all know and love Micro-Services. If you don't you really should read up on them.

Micro Services allow us to build small scalable services that work with one another that we can quickly iterate on and build our innovative products, services, or platforms.

NJax was built specifically with Micro Services in mind from day 1.
